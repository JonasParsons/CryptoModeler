# Trading Bot

This repository contains a machine learning-powered trading bot designed to predict and execute trades in cryptocurrency markets based on historical data. The bot uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to analyze market trends and generate predictions on price movements. The objective of this project is to create an algorithmic trading solution that can optimize profit over time while minimizing losses.

## Project Overview

The trading bot uses machine learning algorithms to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies and make automated buy/sell decisions. It is built with a focus on optimization through hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** and real-time decision making based on historical data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for model building and training)
- **Optuna** (for hyperparameter optimization)
- **pandas** (for data handling)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** (for visualization)
- **TA-Lib / Custom Indicators** (for technical analysis)
- **API Integration** (for live trading using exchanges like Binance)

## Features

- **LSTM-Based Model**: Predicts cryptocurrency price movements using deep learning.
- **Dynamic Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses **Optuna** for tuning model hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM units, dropout rates, batch sizes, and learning rates.
- **Profit Maximization**: Focuses on generating the highest possible profit using **reward-based optimization**.
- **Early Stopping and Pruning**: Implements **early stopping** and **pruning** based on validation loss to save computational resources.
- **Real-Time Trading**: Can be integrated with real exchange APIs to make live trades once the model is trained.
- **Custom Indicators**: Supports using a wide range of **technical analysis indicators** (RSI, SMA, EMA, etc.) to enhance trading decisions.
